    "# Run Phase: Tackling Overfitting with Cross-Validation and Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "Our previous models performed well locally but failed to generalize to the hidden test set. This is a classic overfitting problem. This notebook introduces a more robust training and validation strategy to combat this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Upgrades:**\n",
    "1.  **Cross-Validation (`StratifiedKFold`):** Instead of a single train/validation split, we will use 5-fold cross-validation. This gives us a much more reliable estimate of our model's true performance on unseen data.\n",
    "2.  **Regularization:** We will add parameters to both our `TfidfVectorizer` and `LGBMClassifier` to deliberately make them simpler, which forces them to learn more general patterns.\n",
    "3.  **Ensembling:** Our final submission will be an average of the predictions from the 5 models trained during cross-validation. This is a powerful technique to improve robustness."
